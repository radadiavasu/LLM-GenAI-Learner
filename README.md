# LangChain Overview  

LangChain is an **open-source framework** for developing applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).  
It provides tools to build scalable, production-ready AI systems.  

### Core Areas  
1. Fundamentals  
2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  
3. Agents

## 🔎 Semantic Search  
Semantic search enhances context-aware text generation using **embeddings (vector representations)**.  

**Example:**  
A PDF contains information about topics A, B, and C. If a user asks about A, semantic search finds similarities with the embeddings and retrieves the most relevant details.

## 🧩 Components of LangChain  

### 1. Models  
- **Language Models** → Standard LLMs used for chatbots and AI agents.  
- **Embedding Models** → Convert text into vectors for semantic search and retrieval.  

### 2. Prompts  
Instructions or inputs you provide to LLMs to guide their responses.  

### 3. Chains  
Chains are pipelines that connect multiple components together to perform tasks.  

- **Parallel Chains** → Generate detailed, report-style answers using multiple LLMs.  
- **Conditional Chains** → Perform different actions based on conditions (e.g., positive/negative feedback workflows).  

### 4. Memory  
LLM APIs are **stateless** (they don’t remember past queries). Memory helps overcome this limitation.  

- **Conversation Buffer Memory** → Stores complete conversation history (expensive for large data).  
- **Conversation Window Memory** → Keeps only the last N interactions.  
- **Summary-Based Memory** → Summarizes history, saving cost and space.  
- **Custom Memory** → Stores personalized or private key facts (e.g., user preferences).  

### 5. Indexes  
Indexes connect external information to the LLM. They include:  
- Document Loader  
- Text Splitter  
- Vector Store  
- Retrievers  

**Use Case Example:**  
Attach a code file → LangChain indexes it → AI suggests improvements or fixes bugs. (Just like we do regularly with chatgpt.)

### 6. Agents  
Agents are advanced AI assistants built on LLMs.  
- Unlike simple chatbots, agents combine **semantic search + embeddings + NLU** to handle complex, non-linear queries.  
- They can not only answer but also **act** (e.g., book tickets, send emails).

Components needed:  
1. Data Loader  
2. Text Splitter  
3. Embeddings (Vectors)  
4. Database (MLOps)  
5. Retrieval  
6. LLM

## 🚀 Applications with LangChain  
- Conversational Chatbots  
- AI Knowledge Assistants (e.g., live class helper)  
- AI Agents (performing real tasks like booking tickets, sending messages)  
- Workflow Automation (productivity tools for companies, schools, or personal use)  
- Summarization / Research Support
